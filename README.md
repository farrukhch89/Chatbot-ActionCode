# Chatbot-ActionCode
Hackathon - Chatbot with integrated weather API

**Hackathon**

The objective of the hackathon is to develop a prototype of the final project specification below with your team. You can use any resources available to you.

**Project Specification**

Based on your knowledge of chatbots from the tutorials, develop a with a custom made chatbot that integrates a weather API. 

The goal of your chatbot is to plan your clothing requirements for a trip that will visit 5 locations in 3 days. 
The bot should be able to review the weather for each of these locations and suggest appropriate clothing for each location for the day that you will visit. 
Your team must indicate which team member wrote each method and document its functionality. 
Each team needs to create a repository for the chatbot and add the lecturer to the project as a member.
There must be evidence of a testing framework for each feature of the chatbot.
There must be evidence that all members have both pulled code from the repository and committed changes to the project at each milestone review.

**Extra Features (Optional)**

Adding a GUI for your chatBot.
Adding audio functionality for your chatBot.

**Milestone reviews**

The work period between each milestone is 2 weeks. 
At the end of the period the team will present their code, pull / commit logs, and a short report to the lecturer for a code interview. 
Once the interviews have been completed, the team will progress onto the next features to implement. 
Based on each milestone review the team must produce a testing framework for the features in the next section of the lifecycle.
Each review cycle will follow the same pattern, but the team must clearly indicate what changes have been made since the previous review.
